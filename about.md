Hey, I'm Wacey. No, it's not a family name. My dad used to ride bulls with professional bull rider (and now a Texas Rodeo Cowboy Hall of Fame inductee) Wacey Cathey.

No, I don't ride bulls.

I'm an entrepreneur and internet marketer. Here I share my knowledge hoping to help others.

### My Story

As far as I know, I was the first person in my family to complete college. My dad was the youngest of 11 kids...so that was a pretty big deal.

I was taught, as most are, that the best way to earn a living is to get a degree and go to work for a good company.

Deep down, I didn't agree with the system and thought there had to be a better way.

Anyway, I did the corporate thing in a cubicle for about seven years. It was boring.

Sure the pay was fine but life has to be more than looking forward to the weekend.

### Now What?

Well, a smart entrepreneur would probably get something up and running before leaving the steady paycheck. I didn't.

I thought freelancing or internet marketing would be easy to figure out by the time my savings were depleted.

### Phase 1: Freelancer

Freelancing as a web designer was pretty much a failure. Technology and standards change a lot...which is fine if you have a passion for it and love following that stuff. It's a convoluted disaster if you don't.

I actually still enjoy following web standards.

Here's the real problem. A freelancer is just an employee with more bosses. Every project comes with a new boss. You better be really good at project management. 

Also, trying to explain that you're actually doing something in the client's best interest when they want flash graphics with prancing unicorns...it's not fun.
